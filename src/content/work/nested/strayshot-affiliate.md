> In order to achieve seamlessly the long-term growth objectives, we decided to build this custom solution.

<a href="https://affiliate.strayshot.game/">Strayshot Affiliate</a> is the custom affiliate portal for StrayShot built specially to meet the needs of the business. Before I started working on this project, the company was using an external provider for its affiliate marketing (Cake). However, the cost of using this provider was expensive. In order to achieve seamlessly the long-term growth objectives, we decided to build this custom solution. Working on this project was challenging and fun as it allowed me to gain a deep understanding of user tracking and concepts specific to digital marketing.
